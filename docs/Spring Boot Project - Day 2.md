# Day 2 - AngularJS & React

Since AngularJS is older, most companies just want to know if you can read/understand it, but **React is the bigger focus**.


## Morning (AngularJS basics)

- Understand directives: $ng-model$, $ng-repeat$, $ng-if$.

- Controllers and $\$scope$.

- How AngularJS connects to a backend API.


## Afternoon (React basics)

- Learn about components (functional and class-based).

- Props vs State.

- Hooks ($useState$, $useEffect$).

- Build a tiny app:

- Show a list of tasks from a mock API ($fetch()$ or $axios$).

- Add a button to add/remove a task.


## Evening (Connect Frontend to Backend)

- Try calling your Spring Boot $/tasks$ endpoint from React using $fetch()$.

- Even if it’s just GET + POST, that’s enough to demonstrate **full-stack flow**.
